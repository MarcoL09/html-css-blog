        <div>Welcome to HTML and CSS Basics!</div>
        <div>Lets start with HTML</div>
        <div>HTML aka Hypertext markup language is the backbone/structure of every website on the world wide web</div>
        <div>It is like the pillars and foundation on which a large monument is built</div>
        <div>Here is the list of topics I will discuss in HTML</div>
        <ul>
            <li>Elements and tags</li>
            <li>HTML boilerplate</li>
            <li>Working with text</li>
            <li>Lists</li>
            <li>Links and images</li>
        </ul>
        <div>Elements are the meat of the website, the contents. They are formatted by an opening tag followed by the content to be displayed and ends with a closing tag</div>
        <div>However, some elements, namely void elements, only have opening tags but no closing tags</div>
        <div>Semantic HTML is what professionals call proper usage of tags for the different kinds of content to be displayed</div>
        <div>For example, the p tag for paragraphs, the ul tag for bullet lists, ol tag for numbered lists and so on</div>
        <div>Some common elements and their respective tags include:</div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>bold,</strong> strong</li>
            <li><em>italicise,</em> em</li>
            <li>bulleted list, ul, li</li>
            <li>numbered list, ol, li</li>
            <li><a href="file:///home/marco/repos/html-css-blog/index.html">links,</a> a</li>
            <li>images, img</li>
        </ul>
        <div>Moving on, the boilerplate of a website is just a fancy way to describe the general structure of the html code written for a basic website</div>
        <div>Before we create the boilerplate, we first create the homepage for our website and name it index.html and then create the boilerplate within the file</div>
        <div>To spare you the boring details, just press ! in vscode or HTML:5 in other text editors to shortcut the creation of your boilerplate</div>
        <div>Next up, we have something that will make up the main bulk of any website, the text! Here we can use different elements to resize them, but the best method for flexible and beautiful text is through CSS which we will cover shortly</div>
        <div>Now, lets look at lists. They are useful in organising information in bulleted and numbered fashion, but I wonder if they can also be used as a flex container in CSS..."(more on that in a bit)"</div>
        <div>And last but certainly not least, we will spend some time looking at links and images</div>
        <div>Links are what makes a website web-like. They allow users to move from one website to another seamlessly through a click of the mouse or move around within the website akin to teleporting</div>
        <div>So, we know that the anchor element, a, is the opening and closing tag that creates a link, but what gives the link the address to go to?</div>
        <div>That would be the href attribute! And yes, before we discuss href, lets talk about attributes. Think of attributes as modifiers to certain elements which provide added functionality to certain elements</div>
        <div>The href attribute in this case, allows us to specify the destination of the link. Another important attribute is "target", which allows us to decide whether the link will open in the current tab or a new one</div>
        <div>By default, the target attribute is set to "_self" but if we wish to open the link in a blank tab, we change the target to "_blank"!</div>
        <div>Finally, and most importantly, if we wish to open another website that is not owned by us using a link on our website, we <strong>MUST</strong> do the following:</div>
        <div>Set "rel" attribute, which is short for relationship, to "noopener noreferrer". This ensures that the owner of the website we are linking to cannot use our link to interact and access our website, and more importantly, cannot gain information about us which would invade our privacy!</div>
        <div>Last thing before I forget, remember how I said we can either link to another website or within our own website? The former is called an absolute link and the latter a relative link</div>
        <div>For absoulte links, we set href to "scheme://domain/path" of the website we wish to link to and for relative links, we set it to "./directory/file" of the file location within our computer or set it to "#xyz" where xyz is the id you give to a specific element in the body "(more on ids in CSS)"</div>
        <div>Alright, thats it for links, honestly I probably shouldve split links and images into two separate topics.. Oh well, let's quickly move on to images </div>
        <div>First off, the image element itself is a void element, so it only has an opening img tag. It has three attributes that are crucial to it:</div>
        <div>Firstly, the src attribute which has similar functionality to href "(Caution! Only use non-copyrighted images)". Next is the alt attribute which is used to describe the image in words</div>
        <div>It is useful for when the image is slow to load as people would be able to understand the thought behind the image and more importantly, provide the visually impaired a description of the image so they can experience the website as others do</div>
        <div>Lastly, the height and width attribute which allows us to decide the size of the image on our website. A good trick is to set one of height or width to auto and change the other value which would proportionalise the image</div>
        <div>One more thing to note: depending on when you're reading this, the technology might've improved but for now, we have four commonly used image formats which allow us to format images based on their properties</div>
        <div>We have jpgs, used for images with large colour palettes but forgoes transparent pixels. We have gifs, used for simple animations but lacks in colour palette and detail.</div>
        <div>We have pngs, used for icons, technical diagrams and logos due to its high level of detail. And lastly we have svgs, which is similar to pngs but is able to scale better than pngs at the cost of being a memory sink</div>
        <div>Wow, we certainly have covered alot in the HTML portion! But we still have so much more to learn about HTML.. Buttons, Tables Headers and Footers etc. </div>
        <div>CSS Basics</div>
        <div>CSS aka Cascading Style Sheets is a fancy name for a styling tool but it is crucial to every website</div>
        <div>It turns our dull and monotone website into whatever we wish for on a 2d plane</div>
        <div>In this section, we will discuss the following CSS concepts and topics:</div>
        <ul>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
        <div></div>
