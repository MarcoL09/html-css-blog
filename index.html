        <div>Welcome to HTML and CSS Basics!</div>
        <div>Lets start with HTML</div>
        <div>HTML aka Hypertext markup language is the backbone/structure of every website on the world wide web</div>
        <div>It is like the pillars and foundation on which a large monument is built</div>
        <div>Here is the list of topics I will discuss in HTML</div>
        <ul>
            <li>Elements and tags</li>
            <li>HTML boilerplate</li>
            <li>Working with text</li>
            <li>Lists</li>
            <li>Links and images</li>
        </ul>
        <div>Elements are the meat of the website, the contents. They are formatted by an opening tag followed by the content to be displayed and ends with a closing tag</div>
        <div>However, some elements, namely void elements, only have opening tags but no closing tags</div>
        <div>Semantic HTML is what professionals call proper usage of tags for the different kinds of content to be displayed</div>
        <div>For example, the p tag for paragraphs, the ul tag for bullet lists, ol tag for numbered lists and so on</div>
        <div></div>
        <div></div>
        <div></div>
        <div></div>
